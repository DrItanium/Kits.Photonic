The Photonic Application Domain Communication Kit

This kit is designed to simplify the act of setting up and maintaining
communication between different application domains. This is actually a lot
harder than it seems because there is always the possibility that an improper
command will cause libraries in different application domains to be loaded in
other application domains. This is not a good thing if things like reloadable
plugins are a desirable feature.
